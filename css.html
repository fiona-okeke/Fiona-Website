        <h1>My CSS Journey</h1>
        <p>My journey with CSS followed a similar trajectory to that of HTML, guided by the exact same YouTuber that first introduced me to the world of coding. Delving into CSS, I discovered a newfound appreciation for the power of style and design in web development. It was exhilarating to witness the transformation of my creations as colour, style, and life were seamlessly woven into my work. Experimenting with different colour palettes became a favourite pastime, as I revelled in the ability to breathe vibrancy and personality into every element of my projects. From illuminating the "Read More" button to elegantly framing text with stylish boxes, CSS offered endless possibilities for creative expression. Each stroke of styling felt like adding brushstrokes to a canvas, bringing my digital creations to life with flair and finesse.</p>
