        My stomach growled in anticipation for the scrumptious meal that I was about to feast on. I was usually not much of a cook; I blame my Mum for spoiling me so much. But I decided that now I was 18 years old, things had to change. Not only was it a new year for me, I was now legally an adult. Two of my New Year resolutions were for me to learn how to cook and for me to educate myself about the things that were going on in our society and environment instead of indulging in celebrity gossip all day.

With that being said, I had started watching documentaries online. It started off with documentaries to do with the solar system and the planet. Did aliens exist? Then it went to videos about recycling, global warming and after a long loophole, I started watching videos to do with animal products and how companies have been complicit with selling consumers things that were detrimental to the environment and to ourselves. After watching a documentary about beef three weeks ago, I made a pact to never eat beef again. That was my way of contributing to the improvement of our environment.

“I’m so glad I’ve educated myself,” I smiled.
My favourite meals included minced beef bolognese, beef burgers and steak for special occasions. But I had cooked a roast chicken and potatoes Sunday dinner and I was proud of my result. I was proud of myself for sticking to my New Year’s resolution. I was cooking and staying away from beef and red meat.

“To hell with eating beef, pork and the rest of the other nonsense. From now on, the only meat I’m going to eat is chicken.”
“Erm, what are you talking about? You clearly haven’t educated yourself enough if you think your meal is a better alternative,” my Mum said.

“Chicken is better...right?”
“That’s what they want you to think. You’re sitting there eating chicken and potatoes but why do you think I’m only eating the potatoes and not joining you to eat the chicken too? Why do you think I have been vegetarian for 3 years now?”

“But.. but.”
“If chicken was so much better, don’t you think I would have joined you by now to demolish that chicken? But I stay far away from it for a reason.”

“And what is that reason?”
“You need to continue to search for the knowledge that you’ve been seeking for.”
“But I don’t understand! Eating chickens are better for the environment than eating pork or beef, chickens live in better conditions, chickens are better.”
“Are you kidding me!” she exclaimed. “Chickens live in better conditions?” “Yes they do!” I retorted back defensively.
“Ok, so what do you think caused bird flu?”

I sat quietly, waiting for her to answer her own question.
“Bird flu came because of the treacherous conditions that poultry are kept in. They’re locked in tight, confined factory farms and injected with chemicals to grow them. And so diseases spread from these unhygienic conditions these animals are kept in. Which enables these viruses to mutate at levels that are unprecedented.”
“Wait.. really?”
“Yes really. You have been fed the lie that chickens are the better alternative. But they’re not necessarily.”
“But they’re not as harmful to the environment, right?”
“Wrong. What are chickens fed with?”
“Soya?”
“Right. This soya that they’re fed with comes from the forest. They destroy forests in Brazil and South America just to make space to grow soya for chickens.”

I sat in shock for a couple of seconds, as the realisation came crashing down like a ton of bricks. “Mum, I’m literally speechless right now. I have been so misinformed.”
My Mum gave me a sympathetic smile.
“So you mean to tell me,” I continued, “that I can’t eat any meat ever again?”
“You can do whatever you want. You’re 18. So very young. This is the age where you embark on your journey of self-discovery. Where you educate yourself and question everything you have ever been taught. It is no longer my job to give you the black and white answer to life anymore. Just know that your mother has your back no matter what decision you make.”

I was fighting off the urge to remain in denial but I knew deep down that my mother was right. I was just relieved that I had my mother as my moral support and guidance. I felt reassured that I had finally learnt the truth but also daunted with the fact that there were still a whole world of truths out there waiting to be discovered.
I instantly knew the decision I had to make.
